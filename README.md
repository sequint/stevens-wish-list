# Steven's Wish List
A simple, somewhat janky, but fun site for my secret santa to see the gifts I want.

The site came from a family member not appreciating my copy and paste skills over text and wanting a more pleasing version of my Christmas list.

So here it is :)  I somewhat more pleasing version.
