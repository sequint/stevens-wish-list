# Steven's Wish List
A simple, but fun static site for my secret santa to see the gifts I want.

The site came from a family member not appreciating my copy and paste skills over text and wanting a more pleasing version of my Christmas list.

So here it is, a somewhat more pleasing version.

## Tech
Next.js

Above all, this was a fun little project to explore Next.

Pro tip: take extra caution on version when deploying a Nextjs app.

## Deployed Site

TBD
